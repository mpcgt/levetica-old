# Levetica

### Hi, there, üëãüèº

![Levetica-removebg-preview](https://github.com/mpcgt/levetica/assets/151950243/362fd3f5-5def-45a3-9a94-263ad6d9821a)

**The digital world is dominated by the GAFAMs** (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft). These web giants offer convenient and popular services, **but they also raise concerns** about privacy, surveillance, ethics and concentration of power.

**That's why I created Levetica.** My aim is to **share information and thoughts on alternatives to GAFAM.** I want to encourage people to **explore solutions that are more respectful of privacy, ethics and diversity.**

**I believe that everyone has the right to choose the digital tools they use.** Levetica aims to **empower people to free themselves from dependence on GAFAM** and build a freer, more open web.

**By exploring these alternatives, you can reduce your dependence on GAFAM and contribute to a more diverse and data-friendly web.**

See you soon and thank you to those who support me by leaving a star in my project ;)
